US Places ordered by Population

For right now it just included data from the 2010 Census.

Gathered by querying the Census database at
https://factfinder.census.gov/ and then performing some additional
processing.

Used the Advanced search with the following paramaters.

People: Basic Count / Estimate: Population Total

Geographies: State: Place (160)
             Urban Area (400)

             County (050)
             Metro/Micro Stat. Area (310)
             American Indian Areas/Alaska Native Areas/Hawaiian Home Lands (250)

And then selecting: TOTAL POPULATION: 2010 SF2 100% Data

Note data from 050, 310 & 250 are in the currently unused in the final
